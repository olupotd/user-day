Hi guys, I'm kind of new to this github. But i've gotten used to it except that i'm hoping that you guys could help me
with something regarding Java RMI. I'm designing a calendar application in Distributed systems and it's supposed to store 
different events ranging from user(private), group events and public events. It's also supposed to alert a user of the upcoming
events and allow a user to update(modify), add or view events. No offence but i've done it half way and just in case 
you guys have the time and can help me, I'd be so appreciative. Thanks. good day
